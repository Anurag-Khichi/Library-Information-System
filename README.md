# Library-Information-System
An institute library has 200000+ books. Books are regularly issued by members on loan and returned after a period. Library Information System manages the books, the members and the issue-return process. Every book has title, author, publisher, year of publication, ISBN number (which is unique for the publication), and accession number (which is the unique number of the copy of the book in the library). There may be multiple copies of the same book in the library. Every member has name, roll number, department, gender, mobile number, date of birth, and degree (undergrad, grad, doctoral). Every member has a maximum quota for the number of books she / he can issue for the maximum duration allowed to her /him. 

The library has the following rules for issue:  
1. A book may be issued to a member if it is not already issued to someone else. Also, a book may not be issued to a member if another copy of the same book is already issued to the same member. No issue will be allowed also if the quota is exceeded for the member.
